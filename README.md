**Research Question**


The research question is to explore the correlation between economic freedom of a country and the number of terrorist incidents in that country for the corresponding year.
There is a link drawn between poverty and the tendency of people to indulge in terrorist activities. The rationale behind this is that a person form economically poor background can be easily radicalized into becoming a terrorist. Hence, a country that scores poor on the economic freedom score, will be a hotbed of terrorist activities and will see a large number of terrorist incidents. In this research, we test this hypothesis.
The dependent variable is Number of Terrorist Incidents and independent variable is Economic Freedom Score.
